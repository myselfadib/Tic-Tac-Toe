# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows two players to take turns and competes for a victory in a 3x3 grid. The game features a graphical user interface and highlights the winning moves.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Two players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their marks ('X' and 'O').
3. The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the result.
4. If a player wins, their winning moves are highlighted in green.
5. If there is no winner and all cells are filled, the game ends in a tie.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes bundled with Python)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install tkinter` (if Tkinter is not already installed).
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the game script by executing the following command: `python tic_tac_toe.py`.
6. Play the game by clicking on the grid cells.
